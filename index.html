            <h2>Step 4: Push your project to your GitHub account</h2>
            <p>To push a project to GitHub, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account

                        <li>Choose a name for your repository: You can choose a name like vending-machine-app for your module 1 capstone project and money-transfer-app for your module 2 capstone. </li>
                        <li>Make it public</li>
                        <li><strong> DO NOT </strong>check the “Add a README file” as your project already has a README.md file
                        </li>
                        <li>Click on “Create repository”</li>
                        <li>Once your project is created, you will see a window like below:</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Click on the "HTTPS" option and copy the URL provided by clicking the button as shown in the screenshot above</li>
                <li>Navigate to the directory where your project is saved on your local machine. If you are using MacOS or Linux, open your terminal and if you are using Microsoft Windows, open your GitBash and run the command " <code>rm -rf .git </code>" to delete your Git history.</li>
                <li>Create a new Git repository by running the following command: " <code>git init</code> "</li>
                <li>
                    Add files to the staging area and commit your changes: In the terminal, run the command "<code>git add .</code>" to add all files in your project directory to the staging area. If you only want to add specific files, replace "." with the file names. Run the command 
    "<code>git commit -m '[Commit message]'</code>" to commit your changes to the local repository. Replace [<code>Commit message</code>] with a short description of the changes you made (e.g. Initial commit).
                </li>
                <li>Connect your local repository to the remote repository: In the terminal, run the command "<code>git remote add origin [Paste the GitHub repository URL you copied earlier]</code>" to connect your local repository to the remote repository you just created on GitHub.
                </li>
                <li>Push changes to the remote repository: In the terminal, run the command "<code>git push origin main</code>" to push the changes from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Check the remote repository: Refresh your browser and navigate to your repository on GitHub. You should see the files you just pushed. Congratulations! Your project is now successfully pushed to GitHub.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Step 5: Share your project:</h2>
            <p>After you push your project to your GitHub account, share it on various social media platforms, including Twitter and LinkedIn. You can also reach out to relevant communities and forums to showcase your project and get feedback from other developers.</p>
